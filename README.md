Project Summary
In this repository, I built a full end‑to‑end analytics pipeline using Python, dbt, and Looker Studio. First, Python scripts (with SQLAlchemy and Pandas) extracted raw data from MySQL and loaded it into a Postgres “raw” schema for three core tables: products, orders, and website_sessions. Next, dbt transformed and tested that raw data—creating standardized staging views (stg_products, stg_orders, stg_website_sessions) and then modeling them into warehouse tables and marts (dim_products, fct_orders_product_daily, fct_website_sessions_utm_source_daily). Finally, I connected Postgres to Looker Studio, defined joins between products and orders, and built interactive dashboards: one showing orders to revenue, and another tracking session counts, repeat rates, and channel performance over time. Every layer includes version control (GitHub), CI/CD automation (GitHub Actions), and documentation, resulting in a reliable, maintainable pipeline from source systems through to actionable visualizations.
